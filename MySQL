<What happens if a user forgets password in mysql>

MySQL client - used to connect with MySQL server
MySQL server - used to host variou databases

Installing MySQL:
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install mysql-server

Verify MySQL service status, though it starts automatically after its successful installation
$ sudo systemctl status mysql

Make the installation secure:

Login to mysql with a specific user and password(in the below command root can be replaced with any username)
mysql -u root -p

Show all the available databases
SHOW DATABASES;

Delete a particular database
DROP DATABASE <database_name>;

Create database with default character set of utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci
<MariaDB Command> create database <database_name> default character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci;
<MySQL Command> create database <database_name> character set UTF8mb4 collate utf8mb4_bin;
Accoding to MySQL utf8 is an alias of UTF8mb4. Hence we should use UTF8mb4 collate utf8mb4_bin instead of utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci

Create a user for the database and give some priviledges --> newuser should be replaced with the user name and password should be replaced by the password
<MariaDB Command> grant all on <database_name>.* to '<user_name>'@'<localhost or ip_address_of_host>' identified by '<password>'
<MySQL Command> CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
<MySQL Command> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'newuser'@'localhost'; ---> the * refer to the database and table respectively.
<MySQL Command> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
To provide a specific user with a permission, you can use this framework:
<MySQL Command> GRANT <type_of_permission> ON <database_name>.<table_name> TO ‘username’@'localhost’;
<MySQL Command> REVOKE <type_of_permission> ON <database_name>.<table_name> FROM ‘username’@‘localhost’;
<MySQL Command> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'username'@'localhost';
<MySQL Command> DROP USER ‘username’@‘localhost’;
Types of priviledges are as follow:
->ALL PRIVILEGES- allows a MySQL user full access to a designated database (if no database is selected, global access)
->CREATE- allows them to create new tables or databases
->DROP- allows them to them to delete tables or databases
->DELETE- allows them to delete rows from tables
->INSERT- allows them to insert rows into tables
->SELECT- allows them to use the SELECT command to read through databases
->UPDATE- allow them to update table rows
->GRANT OPTION- allows them to grant or remove other users’ privileges

For Wordpress the commands that need to be run:
